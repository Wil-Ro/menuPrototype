## What is this?
A small tool to make testing out the positions of volumes for a gesture system I'm working on easier, for an open source project called aardvark, you can find it 
[here](https://github.com/aardvarkxr/aardvark)

## How do I use this?
Move the volumes around using the buttons on the display, press "log transforms" when you're finished and pop the formatted log into the dictionary in aardvark\websrc\default_hands\src\default_hands_gesture_volumes.ts! easy!

you can access the tool [here](https://wil-ro.github.io/menuPrototype/)
